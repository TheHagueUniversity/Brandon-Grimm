        <p class="Intro">
            From a young age, I have been a Formula 1 enthusiast. The game 
            enabled me to be immersed in a life that I could not live. One 
            of the most important parts of the immersion is the Ai you are 
            racing against. 
        </p>
             <p class="Intro">
                As I lived in Namibia Online racing was rather difficult 
                because of latency issues I faced. So, I took it upon myself to improve the Ai.       
             </p>

       
        <p class="Intro">
            The game realised on 2nd October 2014 and I started tinkering around 
            with the Ai mid-October. I was incredibly happy with my results. 
            The final mod was released on the 10th of  November 2014. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="Role">The <br>
            Challenge</h2>

        <p class="Intro">
            Once I started to race online I shared my file with fellow League 
            racers and asked for opinions. Through multiple conversations and testing.
        </p>

        <p class="Intro">
            We came on these Goals:

    <h2 class="Role-2">Final Mod</h2>

    <p class="Intro">
        Through much talking with friends and fellow league drivers, I 
        came on the conclusion that the aggression on the ai was too weak 
        and we wanted to make the offline career mode racing more exciting 
        so I changed the code on the research I  had gotten from the
         previous discussion and through many trials, cars just went 
         far too slow through corners and them just too uncommon for 
         mechanical issues. I finally came to something that achieved 
         what we looked for.
    </p>

    <p class="Intro">
        So, this has been increased and the chances of spinning out 
        in the rain have been increased.
    </p>

    <p class="Intro">
        This mod significantly improves the aggression of ai drivers.
         They try to take the inside line more often or the outside 
         line they do not back out of overtakes so easily and are 
         determined to overtake. Reviews are mutely appreciated. 
    </p>
    <p class="Intro">
        On the  10th of  November  2014, I uploaded the mod and 
        after 5 years it has accumulated over 1500 downloads.
