           <p class="Intro">The moment you tell a dutch person you are coming to visit
               their country and ask how you can get around they will 
               insist you use the 9292 app. But the app lacks vital 
               features, feels outdated and is too complex, and therefore 
               gives off this negative experience and foreigners question 
               why do they not just use google maps.</p>
               
            
            <p class="Intro">My partner, Adam, & I decided upon ourselves to dig deeper
                and identify all flaws and find possible solutions to these 
                underlying issues.</p> 
                

            <p class="Intro">9292 has been the go-to app for many dutch citizens but with 
                a growing number of users being frustrated due to lack of 
                updates and support. There were a growing number of fundamental 
                flaws. With the rapid growth in users and the last update in 2018, 
                the 9292 app has become outdated and is now the predecessor of public 
                transportation apps.</p>

            Adam & I are both first-year student in  The Hague University of 
            Applied Sciences. We both have had set our roles to work as a design 
            team and work as partners throughout the whole design process.

        <h2 class="Problem">Our Problem</h2>

        <p class="Intro">
                        At the start of the project, we knew there where major 
                        issues. So we both told each other to use the app for a 
                        set week to really get a feel for it and be a user of the app. 
                        We had no previous research no insights or any data to work on. 
                        We had to start from ground zero. 
        </p>

        <p class="Intro">
                        After our week of using the app, we came together and wrote 
                        all our whole experience, what we felt, what was good and bad 
                        and what we felt needed drastic improvement. 
        </p>

        <p class="Intro">
                        We wrote down all our initial thoughts and assumptions down.

                Once we had all our necessary information we realised we needed too 
                confirm our set assumptions and thoughts.
