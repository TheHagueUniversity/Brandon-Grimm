            My name is Brandon Grimm as you have probably identified by now.
            I was born and raised in a beautiful diverse country called 
            Namibia and I am studying at The Hague University of Applied 
            Sciences undertaking the major User  Experience Design. I am 
            currently looking to expand my knowledge as a Junior UX Designer 
            within an Internship role.
            <br>
            <br> I have had a deep fascination
            towards the interaction between a person and a piece of technology. 
            Understanding the user, is crucial part of UX and this is what led 
            my passion for UX as from a young age I was fascinated watching my
            dad playing video games seeing the different techniques used to 
            create a more immersive world. <br><br>
            
            This shaped my desire to be involved 
            with something that creates an meaningful experience, an experience 
            shaped by the user and his needs. I always shared a this passion to 
            help others, to explain in a way that that individual would understand.
            I find it extremely gratifying to see people grasp the concept  of a 
            product without much explanation.
