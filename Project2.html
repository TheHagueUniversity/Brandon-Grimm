        <p class="Intro">
            Hallmark is a renowned greeting card company, for years it been, 
            the best way to create a card that is far more personal, than just a
            shop-bought card. </p>
            
         
         <p class="Intro">
            I was part of a two-man partner team to create an improved version
            of the Card Personalisation Tool, a Physical card and lastly a 
            Bespoke Digital Unwrapping experience that expresses the giver’s 
            emotional message

        <p class="text-ch">
            Digital gift are  becoming more apparent in our daily lives, more of the daily utilities
            are becoming digital and with this are the gifts we send to each other. 
            How can one recreate a 
            digital unboxing experience that resembles the physical one? 
            So,  this becomes our goal create card tool that would Hallmarks existing one,  
            create a physical representation of an end product from the Card personalisation
            tool and have that card lead to a digital unwrapping. The digital unwrapping would 
            need to be a bespoke design created for our Persona.

    <h2 class="Role-1">My Involvement</h2></div>

        <img class="svg-1" src="Image/project/P2/Involve.svg">
        <p class="text-in">
            I was in a Design Team with Adam Schwarcz from November 2019 
            until January of 2020. I went through the whole design process. 
            I worked Co &  Co with Adam on every step of the design  process.
            The final prototype was presented to Hallmark on the 24th January 2020.

    <h2 class="Role-start">The Start</h2></div>

    
    <p class="text">
            The first thing I did was to brainstorm what was important to an unwrapping
            experience what values are important.</p>
            
         
         <p class="text">
            Further on I went onto Hallmark and bought a card an Anniversary card for
            my parents and went through the whole process to understand it and
            to build a foundational understanding. 
        </p> 
        <p class="text">
            Then inside the design team, we identified key problem areas and 
            things we wanted to find out.

        We were given set users from our Lectures of the University which 
        we had to conduct user interviews with. Anything from the informal 
        interview's till observations. Through this research, we gained some 
        promising early insights.</p>

        <p class="text-early">
            To confirm some of our theories we created a physical unwrapping 
            for Sinterklaas. The whole idea was to gain insights into how the 
            user reacts and feels when unwrapping and what values he puts on 
            what part of the unwrapping.

            Writing our design Vision Me & Adam gathered our Research

        <p class="text">
            Furthermore, I put more emphasis on the main insights I 
            had to make sure I do not lose track of these. Once I  
            had that we focused on the individual goals we as a team 
            wanted to accomplish with all parts of the projects.

                For our Persona, it was really important that it incorporated all aspects of
                our User’s and really showcased their struggles and that someone
                unaware of the project would be able to grasp the direction we

                looked at which one suits our needs the best. From here onwards 
                Adam took responsibility for the UI for the Card Personalisation 
                Tool and I took over the UI for the Unwrapping. I & Adam continued

            I started with visualising the ideas on a low fidelity prototype and 
            then doing tests to see if that feeling we were chasing after for was
            there and to see if there was core hence to the story and Unwrapping
            experience. Once we conducted those we went to digital prototyping.

                The Final Product did not represent the visual idea we originally 
                had we wanted it to be in a 3D space. But we did learn valuable 
                insights from our prototypes. The Digital unwrapping did have the 
                aspects we wanted to contain. We just ran short on time and did 
                not have the skill set jet to create it the way we imagined. We 
                focused too much on the  Card Personalisation Tool which led us 
                to have unevenly balanced experience. When redoing this project 
                I would put more emphasis on how to enhance the digital experience
                 and allow for a  more diverse way of prototyping. The skills 
                 needed to recreate the ideas we pictured are not possible on a 
                 prototyping tool. As the vision was to have a 3D explorer able 
                 room. those we went to digital prototyping.
